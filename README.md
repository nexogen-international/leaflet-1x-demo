__Important notes:__

To test the Leaflet Routing Machine NEXOGEN GIS Routing API v2 plug-in locally, you need to use a local CORS proxy first.
One suggestion is to install `local-cors-proxy` via `npm`.

```
npm install -g local-cors-proxy
lcp https://{api_url_placeholder}
```

where `{api_url_placeholder}` is your URL referring to your designated NEXOGEN GIS API endpoint.
